For this assignment, please grade myserver.c.

I also included my client: myclient.c
and time_server.c, which was my first draft.

I used Beej's guide as a source for basic server code.
I collaborated with Stephen Rinkus.

To compile use Makefile.Usage:
>./myserver "port number"
>./myclient localhost



Architecture

Server -

Initiate variables;

Check args, if no port number is given exit;

Retrieve port number from args;

Populate addrinfo struct "hints";

Convert IP addrs into server info struct

loop until socket is successfully bound{

  get new socket;

  try to bind socket;
}

listen on specified port;

Main accept loop{

    accept connection to their_addr;
    
    get time;

    set buff to ctime of time;

    fork;

    close parent;

    send;

    exit child;

    close new_fd;
}

end;

Client -

Initiate Variables;

Check args, if no hostname is given exit;

Convert IP addrs into server info struct;

loop until socket is successfully bound{

    get new socket;

    try to bind socket;
}

if socket couldn't bind print error and return 2;

connect to server;

recv information, if entire buffer isn't read error and exit;

Null terminate string;

Print info received from server;

close socket;

end;

}
