I apologize for submitting so many times. I foud out I was using the wrong command to tar up the files. I would over write my files with my old ones every time. Here's my working copy of asg2

#To make just run
> make

#Run server
> ./myserver [server_port]
#Run myclient
> ./myclient [file_name] [number_of_servers]

Architecture

Server -

Initiate variables;

Check args, if no port number is given exit;

Retrieve port number from args;

Populate addrinfo struct "hints";

Convert IP addrs into server info struct

loop until socket is successfully bound{

  get new socket;

  try to bind socket;
}

listen on specified port;

Main accept loop{

    accept connection to their_addr;
    
    get file name

    get file offset

    git number of servers

    open file

    seek to offset

    find file size

    find number of bytes to read

    find actual offset

    read bytes into buffer 

    fork;

    close parent;

    send buffer;

    exit child;

    close new_fd;
}

end;

Client -

Initiate Variables;

Check args, if no hostname is given exit;

open serverinfo.txt

loop over the hosts and ports in server-info.txt{

get a new host and port, put in struct

put struct in linked list

}

loop over new linked list  socket is successfully bound{

    get new socket;

    try to bind socket;

    store fd in rset;
}

loop over linked list until the bytes are received{

send over the file name, number of servers, and file offset;

recv information, if entire buffer isn't read error and exit;

Null terminate string;

Print info received from server into output file;

} //end infinite for loop

close socket;

end;

}
