Architecture

Server -

Initiate variables;

get new socket;

Check args, if no port number is given exit;

Retrieve port number from args;

Convert IP addrs into server info struct

bind socket;

Main accept loop{

    get info from client            
    
    get file name

    get file offset

    git number of servers

    open file

    seek to offset

    find file size

    find number of bytes to read

    find actual offset

    read bytes into buffer 

    send buffer;

}

end;

Client -

Initiate Variables;

Check args, if no hostname is given exit;

open server-info.txt

loop over the hosts and ports in server-info.txt{

get a new host and port, put in struct

put struct in linked list

}

loop over new linked list  socket is successfully bound{

    get new socket;

    connect socket to server;

    store fd in rset;
}

loop over linked list until the bytes are received{

send over the file name, number of servers, and file offset;

recv information, if entire buffer isn't read error and exit;

Null terminate string;

Print info received from server into output file;

} //end infinite for loop

close sockets;

close files;

free variables;

end;

}
