	     micro_proxy - really small HTTP/HTTPS proxy

micro_proxy is a very small HTTP/HTTPS proxy.  It runs from inetd,
which means its performance is poor.  But for low-traffic sites,
it's quite adequate.  It implements all the basic features of an
HTTP/HTTPS proxy, in only 260 lines of code.

See the manual entry for more details.

To build: If you're on a SysV-like machine (which includes old Linux systems
but not new Linux systems), edit the Makefile and uncomment the SYSV_LIBS
line.  Otherwise, just do a make.
